# Fancy List
<i>README updated at commit 2feae92<i/>

![](VidForReadme.gif)

This is a list view of strings, implemented in JavaFX, 
without using any of the built-in JavaFX listview features. 
It is an experimentation with custom cell design, angled
list orientation, and other visual effects, such as edge 
fading.

It supports drag and drop reorder and file persistence.
