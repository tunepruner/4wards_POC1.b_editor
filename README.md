This project is written in Java 1.8 with JavaFX.  
It doesn't use any of the built-in JavaFX listview features or scrolling. 
The cells are made from scratch out of composite shapes. 
Data is serialized in xml format using JAXB.

It features drag and drop reorder, single-dimensional scrolling, and data persistence. 

The progress bar, and other elements seen on each cell have no functionality, 
and are only included for demonstration purposes.
