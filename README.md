This project is a demo of functionality I'm working on with the ![4wards project](github.com/tunepruner/4wards). It's written in Java 1.8 with JavaFX.  
It doesn't use any of the built-in JavaFX listview features or scrolling. 
The cells are made from scratch out of composite shapes. 
Data is serialized in xml format using JAXB.

It features drag and drop reorder and single-dimensional scrolling. 

The progress bar, and other elements seen on each cell have no functionality yet; they're included here to demonstrate one way that the unique shape of these cells could be used.
