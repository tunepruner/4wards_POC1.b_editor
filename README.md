This is a list view of strings, implemented in JavaFX, 
without using any of the built-in JavaFX listview features or scrolling. 
It is an experimentation with custom cell design, angled list orientation, 
and other visual effects, such as edge fading.

It supports drag and drop reorder, single-dimensional scrolling, and data persistence. 

The progress bar, and other elements seen on each cell have no functionality, 
and are only included for demonstration purposes.
